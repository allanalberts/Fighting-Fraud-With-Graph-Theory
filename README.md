# Impoving-Trust-in-Marketplace-User-Ratings
Creating a trusted environment is essential for successful online marketplaces. Unfortunetly, unscrupulous users will devise schemes to manipulate user ratings and thus, undermine this trust. My project's goal is to build a predictive model to identify users who are likely to create negative experiences for other marketplace users. I will do this by engineering relevant features using graph theory and timeseries velocity metrics.

### Bitcoin Trading Marketplaces
Bit coin peer-to-peer (P2P) markplaces are particularly suseptable to fraud given the anomanity related to bit coins. The OTC Bitcoin Marketplace is a place where users can trade bitcoin for service or products or vice versa. Trust is established by having users rate each other based on the experience of their interactions. Ratings range from -10 for completely untrustworthy to +10 for very trusted. However, while this system my seem helpful, it can be manipulated by fraudsters and undermine the marketplace brand. 

### The OTC Bitcoin Marketplace
involving manipulated user ratings. (talk about why this is) 
- explain the marketplaces and show timeline overview of ratings activity



### Identifying Ratings Boosted through User Colusion
- explain how fraud occurs
- show eda example visualization of fraud

### Feature Engineering with Graph Theory for collusion identification
### Feature engineering for velocity metrics
### Features base on aggregate user ratings

### Model Tuning

### Model Results
compare to no system
- confusion matrics
- precision-recall curve
### Next Steps
- help user understand reasons for potential negative rating predictions - use feature analysis and shap
