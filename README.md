# Establishing-Trust-in-User-Ratings
This project utilizes graph theory and deep learning to identify fraud in P2P marketplace user ratings.


The ability to trust other users is a key requirement for successful peer-to-peer (P2P) marketplaces. Trust is established through user ratings of interactions with other users. However, ratings can be manipulate by by sellers who use multiple accounts that they control to create fake positive ratings for themselves. This project combines graph theory with deep learing to identify manipulated user ratings.

Bit coin P2P markplaces are particularly suseptable to fraud involving manipulated user ratings. (talk about why this is)
